Requirements for IPsec Remote Access Scenarios

Status of this Memo

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does
   not specify an Internet standard of any kind.

Abstract

   This document describes requirements for IP Security (IPsec) when
   used in remote access scenarios. Remote access refers to the 
   situation where a mobile or remote host needs secure access to
   a corporate network over the Internet.

1. Introduction

   IPsec provides a framework for providing security services at the
   IP layer. When used for remote access, there are additional 
   requirements beyond those for site-to-site VPN scenarios.

2. Terminology

   Remote Access Client: A host that initiates an IPsec connection
   to access resources on a protected network.

   Security Gateway: A device that terminates IPsec tunnels and
   provides access control to the protected network.

3. Requirements

   3.1 Authentication
   
   The remote access client must authenticate to the security gateway
   using strong authentication methods such as certificates or 
   one-time passwords.

   3.2 Address Assignment
   
   The security gateway must be able to assign an internal IP address
   to the remote access client for use within the protected network.

This is a sample RFC file for testing the P2P-CI system.
