A Proferred Official ICP

This RFC describes the Initial Connection Protocol (ICP) used to 
establish connections between hosts on the ARPANET.

The protocol defines the following steps:

1. The user process on the requesting host contacts the server process
   on the responding host using a well-known socket.

2. The server allocates a new socket pair for the connection.

3. Data transfer begins using the allocated sockets.

This is a sample RFC file for testing the P2P-CI system.
