Domain Names and Company Name Retrieval

Status of this Memo

   This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
   community.  It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.

Abstract

   This document describes a system for mapping company names to 
   domain names using a distributed database architecture.

1. Introduction

   The rapid growth of the Internet has led to an increasing need
   for intuitive domain name systems that can map human-readable
   company names to their corresponding domain names.

2. Protocol Overview

   The protocol operates as follows:
   
   a) Client sends a query containing the company name
   b) Server performs lookup in the database
   c) Server returns matching domain names

This is a sample RFC file for testing the P2P-CI system.
