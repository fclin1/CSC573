TCP/IP Illustrated

Status of this Memo

   This memo provides information for the Internet community. It does
   not specify an Internet standard of any kind.

Abstract

   This document provides a comprehensive guide to TCP/IP protocols,
   covering the fundamental concepts of internetworking and the
   protocol stack that powers the modern Internet.

1. Introduction

   The TCP/IP protocol suite is the foundation of the Internet. This
   RFC provides an illustrated guide to understanding how these
   protocols work together to enable global communication.

2. The Protocol Stack

   2.1 Link Layer
   
   The link layer handles the physical transmission of data over
   network hardware such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi.

   2.2 Network Layer (IP)
   
   The Internet Protocol (IP) provides addressing and routing
   functionality, enabling packets to traverse multiple networks.

   2.3 Transport Layer (TCP/UDP)
   
   TCP provides reliable, ordered delivery of data streams.
   UDP provides connectionless, best-effort delivery.

   2.4 Application Layer
   
   Application protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP operate at this
   layer, providing services to end users.

3. Conclusion

   Understanding TCP/IP is essential for network programming and
   Internet application development.
