Routing Protocols

   This memo provides information for the Internet community. It does
   not specify an Internet standard of any kind.

Abstract

   This document describes the various routing protocols used in
   IP networks to determine optimal paths for packet forwarding.

1. Introduction

   Routing protocols are essential for the operation of large-scale
   IP networks. They enable routers to exchange information about
   network topology and compute optimal paths.

2. Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs)

   2.1 RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
   
   RIP is a distance-vector protocol that uses hop count as its
   metric. Maximum hop count is 15.

   2.2 OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
   
   OSPF is a link-state protocol that uses Dijkstra's algorithm
   to compute shortest paths. It supports hierarchical routing
   through the use of areas.

   2.3 IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)
   
   IS-IS is another link-state protocol, originally designed for
   OSI networks but adapted for IP routing.

3. Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs)

   3.1 BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
   
   BGP is the routing protocol used between autonomous systems
   on the Internet. It is a path-vector protocol that enables
   policy-based routing decisions.

4. Conclusion

   The choice of routing protocol depends on network size,
   topology, and administrative requirements.
